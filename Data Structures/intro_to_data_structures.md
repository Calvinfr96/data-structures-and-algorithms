# Introduction To Data Structures

## Purpose
- Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
- Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized while others, like arrays, are more genetically used.
- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely it is youâ€™ll need to use one the more specialized data structures to solve a problem. Also, there are certain specialized data structures you regularly interact with as a programmer.
    - The DOM is a tree data structure.
    - Certain APIs may return data in the form of a graph.
    - Knowing how these specialized data structures work will help you interact with them, and problem solve more efficiently.
- Data structures also come up a lot during interviews.
- There is no one best data structures, the all excel in different environments. For example, a linked list can be used as an alternative to an array when you need to quickly insert and remove data from the beginning or middle.
