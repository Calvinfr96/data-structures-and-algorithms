# Big O Notation

- For all data structures and algorithms (DSA) problem you encounter, there will be many implementations that work. Big O notation is used to determine which implementation is best. It is a system of generalizing and comparing code in terms of their efficiency. It gives you a numeric representation of the efficiency of code.
- Big O notation is also useful for talking about the trade-offs between different approaches.
- When trying to debug code, it helps to understand efficiency to pin point problems that make your code slower.

## Timing Code
- Problem Statement: Write a function that calculates the sum of all integers from one up to and including some number n.
- The primary concerns relating to big O are speed and memory usage.
- Timing code by simply recording the start and end time of a function can be problematic because different machines record different times and the same machine can record different times when running the same function using the same inputs.
    - Furthermore, for very performant algorithms, the speed measurements may not be precise enough to show a difference.
- Instead of using time to compare code, Big O Notation compares code based on the number of simple operations that are required to execute the code. A simple operation is something like multiplication or addition. Things like variable declarations are also considered simple operations, but you donâ€™t need to get to bogged down in the details for the purposes of the analysis. Take the following two function:  
```
function addUpTo(n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```  
And  
```
function addUpTo(n) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        total += i;
    }
    return total;
}  
```
- The first implementation has a total of three simple operations:
    1. Multiplication
    2. Division
    3. Addition
    - It is also important to note that the number of operations remains the same regardless of the input n.
- The second implementation has a variable number of operations that depends on the input n. If n is 5, there is a total of 5 operations (5 additions). If n is 1,000,000,000, there is a total of 1,000,000,000 operations (1,000,000,000 additions). Breaking down the function, for iteration of the loop, there are:
    1.	4 assignments (```i++``` counts as an addition and assignment).
    2.	2 additions
    3.	1 comparison
    - This means there could be as many as 5n + 2 operations. However, the actual number of operations doesn't matter as much as the general trend of how the number of operations increases with respect to the input. For this function, the number of operations grows proportionally (linearly) with n.
