# Behavioral Questions

- Behavioral questions are asked to get to know your personality, understand your resume more deeply, and ease you into the interview process.
- The best way to prepare for behavioral questions is to go through your major projects or technical roles listed on your resume and answer common behavioral questions for each project or role.
    - Common behavior question topics include challenges, mistakes/failures, things you enjoyed, leadership aspects, conflicts, and what you’d do differently.
- When asked about weaknesses, don’t give a cliché answer. Give an example of a genuine weakness you have and talk about what you do to overcome it.
- When the interviewer gives you a chance to ask questions, ask insightful questions that demonstrate your understanding of technology, as well as questions that show your passion and enthusiasm for the role.
    - I noticed that you use technology X. How did you solve problem Y?
    - I’m very interested in scalability and would love to learn more about it. What opportunities are here for this?
- Be able to speak at great depth about the technical projects on your resume. The projects you list should have challenging components and you should have played a central role in its development.
- When describing your accomplishments, be specific, not arrogant. For example, instead of saying you “did all the hard parts”, list what you actually did and let the interviewer draw their own conclusions.
- Limit details about projects that your interviewer may not know much about. Only list the key details that make you stand out and are relevant to the perspective role.
- Focus on talking about your individual accomplishments and contributions, rather than those of the team you were on.
- Use the STAR method, focusing mostly on the action part of the response. Analyze this part of the response by assessing what personality attributes your actions demonstrate.
- The “tell me about yourself” question is your interviewer’s first impression of you, so you want to make sure you nail this question. You want to start by describing your current role and end by describing your hobbies and interests outside of work.
    - Start with a headline your current role, move on to the background that led you to that role, circle back to describing your current role in more detail, then end with hobbies and interests outside of work.
    - You shouldn’t discuss hobbies if they’re generic or you can’t say much about them other than “I do this”. Instead, focus on hobbies that are unique (such as fire breathing) or technical. Hobbies that demonstrate initiative and a passion for knowledge can also help.
    - These kinds of hobbies can spark a more informal conversation between you and the interviewer that can help end the conversation on a more amiable note.
