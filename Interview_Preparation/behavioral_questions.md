# Behavioral Questions

- Behavioral questions are asked to get to know your personality, understand your resume more deeply, and ease you into the interview process.
- The best way to prepare for behavioral questions is to go through your major projects or technical roles listed on your resume and answer common behavioral questions for each project or role.
    - Common behavior question topics include challenges, mistakes/failures, things you enjoyed, leadership aspects, conflicts, and what you’d do differently.
- When asked about weaknesses, don’t give a cliché answer. Give an example of a genuine weakness you have and talk about what you do to overcome it.
