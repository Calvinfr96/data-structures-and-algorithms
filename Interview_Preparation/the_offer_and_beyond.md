## The Offer and Beyond

## Deadlines and Extensions
- When a company extends you an offer, they usually give you a deadline of one to four weeks to either accept or reject it. If you're still waiting on offers from other companies, you can ask for an extension and most companies will try to be accommodating.
## Declining an Offer
- When you decline an offer, it's important that you do so in a way that amicable. It's also important that you keep a line of communication open so that you can re-apply in the future. Basically, keep your options open.
## Handling Rejection
- Handling rejection in an amicable way is also important because many companies understand the interview process is imperfect, causing lots of qualified engineers to get rejected. As a result, many companies will offer you the chance to apply again in the future or even reach out to you because you almost met the bar last time you interviewed.
- When handling a rejection, be understanding of the recruiter's decision, ask when you would be eligible to apply again, and ask for feedback. Many large companies won't offer feedback, but some smaller ones will.
## Evaluating an Offer
- When evaluating an offer, it's important to look at more than just base salary. You also want' to look at what the company offer in terms of signing bonuses, stock options, relocation bonuses, and other one-time perks. Cash signing bonuses typically vest over one year. Stock grants typically vest over four years (Amazon's vesting schedule is "back-loaded").
- It's also very important to factor in cost-of-living differences when evaluating an offers from different places. A $100,000 offer from a company in Seattle would be a lot better than a $120,000 salary in Silicon Valley because of the significant difference in income tax.
- Perhaps most importantly, you want to evaluate an offer based on your long-term goals. An offer may be great financially but could cause your over-all career growth to stagnate. You also want to assess an offer based on the following:
    - How good does the company look on my resume?
    - How much will I learn? Will it be relevant?
    - What does promotion and career development look like at the company?
    - Does the company offer a realistic plan for moving into management?
    - Is the company or team growing?
    - If I do want to leave the company, will I need to move to find another offer?
- It's also important to consider company stability when accepting an offer. If you're confident in your ability to quickly find a new job if things blow up, then stability might not be that important. If you're less confident or have work visa restrictions, stability may be more important.
- Also consider the happiness factor of the company. Will you enjoy working with your teammates and manager? Will you fit well with the company culture? Will you be working on something you enjoy? How many hours will you need to put in a week, on average?

## Negotiations
- Even though you may not want to, negotiating your job offer is very important, here are some tips for doing so effectively:
    - Just Do It: **Recruiters will not revoke** an offer because you attempted to negotiate it, so you don't have anything to lose. This is especially true at larger companies because you probably won't be negotiating with your future teammates.
    - Have a Viable Alternative: Companies negotiate with candidates because _they're_ afraid of being rejected. Having a viable alternative to present to them will elevate these fears, in your favor.
    - Have a Specific Ask: It's better to have a specific amount in mind when negotiating an offer. For example, ask for an additional $7,000 instead of "more".
    - Overshoot: Ask for more than you really want. Companies will usually reject whatever you ask for anyways, leading to a back-and-forth where you end up meeting in the middle. Asking for more upfront will position the middle ground closer to where you want it.
    - Think Beyond Salary: Consider asking for an increase in non-salary components of your offer, such as the sign-on bonus stock grant, or relocation fees. Companies will be more flexible on these terms since the increase would be a shorter-term commitment than a salary increase.
    User Your Best Medium: Choose a medium for negotiation that your comfortable with. Many people suggest doing it over the phone or via email. What's more important is making an attempt to negotiate than the specific medium.

## On The Job
- Once you join a company, you need to start considering your trajectory within the company and your route toward your destination. 
- To avoid complacency after accepting an offer, make a ten-year plan for yourself and check on it regularly. This will help you determine if your current role is helping you advance toward your goals or if you need to start thinking about taking the next step.

## Build Strong Relationships
- It's important to start building your network as soon as you start in a new position. Make friends with your manager and coworkers and try to keep in touch with people even after they leave. For your current network, keeping in touch is also important. Be opened to helping others and they'll be more open to helping you.
- 
## Ask For What You Want
- While some managers will be eager to help you grow your career, other will take a more hands-off approach. It's important to be upfront about your goals early on so your manager knows you mean business. Tell your manager (reasonably) exactly what you want out of your position and if you aspire for leadership.
- It's also important to show a strong work ethic while asking for these thing

## Keep Interviewing
- Set a goal of interviewing at least once a year, even if you're not actively looking for a new job.
- This will keep your interview skills fresh and keep you apprised on the current state of the job market, in terms of opportunities and salaries.
- If you get an offer, you don't have to take it. It can simply act as a connection with the company should you want to join it in the future.
