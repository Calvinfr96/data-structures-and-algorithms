# Problem Solving Approach

## Objectives
- Define what an algorithm is.
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms.
- Compare and contrast problem-solving patterns including frequency counters, two-pointer problems, and divide and conquer.
What is an algorithm?
- An algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
- Everything you do in programming involves some sort of algorithm.
- You can improve your problem-solving skills by taking the following steps:
    1.	Devise a plan for solving problems.
    2.	Master common problem-solving patterns.
- Problem Solving Approach
    1.	Understand the problem.
    2.	Explore concrete examples.
    3.	Break it down.
    4.	Solve and simplify.
    5.	Look back and refactor.
